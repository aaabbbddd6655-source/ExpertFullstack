After saving, the customer should appear immediately in the list and be selectable for new orders.

3. Settings Page Enhancement (Roles & Language)

Add Roles & Permissions with the following roles:

Define what each role can view/edit (orders, customers, settings, stages, etc.).

Move language selection into Settings so each user can choose Arabic/English as their default.

4. Full Language System Update (Arabic / English)

Add continuous arrow indicators ( → ) to make the stage flow visually clear.

7. Stage Management in Settings

Add Stages Management section inside Settings where the admin can:

Any changes should reflect immediately across all orders.
